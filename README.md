# Welcome to SQU&IRREL

## What is this website?

To be honest, we're not too sure.

It's best described as a mix of Discord's group messaging, Facebook's color aesthetic, Github's and Reddit's dashboard, and the hunger of three college students.

Here you can find groups at MIT (Can be adjusted to include other locations in the future) or in the surrounding Cambridge/Boston area to cook with. Of course, you can use this wonderful website to find other groups oustide of this area.

Not only this, but you can also adjust your own preferences to account for common allergies (ex. nuts, shellfish, soy, etc.) and restrictions (ex. vegan, kosher, etc.). You can also change preferences for your groups so that people can easily find your group through filtering through!

Make friends, eat questionable food that you make together, and ignore the seven groups called "Kradia" that we created for testing purposes.

## How to use:

There are several features in this website:
- Groups (You can make groups and join existing groups. To foster a close relationship with others, you may not leave any groups.)
- Calendar (Feel free to add your own events on your calendar. Best of all, you don't have to deal with Google Calendar's horrible embedded UI thanks to our own special calendar)
- Messages (Each group has its own message board where you can discuss anything you would like.)
- Forum (Post to the world! Whether it be beautiful food pictures, asking for cooking advice, or advertising your own group, here's the place to do it!)
- Profile (Adjust your own preferences so you can be recommended groups that might fit your own interests.)
